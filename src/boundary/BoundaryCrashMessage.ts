The ContractCase core has failed in an unexpected

Please open a bug report here:
https://github.com/case-contract-testing/case/issues/new

It would be great if you could include:

* What you were doing when it failed
* The results of re-running with logLevel: "maintainerDebug"

For bonus points and internet karma, a reproducible 
code sample would be very helpful.

Sorry about this.
