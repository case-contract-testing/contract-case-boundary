# Changelog

## [0.10.3](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case-boundary/compare/@contract-case/case-boundary-v0.10.2...@contract-case/case-boundary-v0.10.3) (2024-02-05)


### Bug Fixes

* Change config so that `providerName` and `testRunId` aren't required. Since the config is nestable, these aren't always going to be present. ([96203ea](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case-boundary/commit/96203ea3d95a96962ccb7ace972cd7fe0c875f57))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Remove StateHandlerWithTeardown; now state handlers are expected to provide both setup and teardown. Use no-op functions returning BoundarySuccess if your DSL allows missing functions

### Features

* Expose library as JSii again ([bbedcaf](https://github.com/case-contract-testing/contract-case/commit/bbedcaf979d799a7afbfb68171d0a9902b56bc9d))
