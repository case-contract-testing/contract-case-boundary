## ContractCaseBoundaryConfig.throwOnFail property

Whether or not the test should throw an error if the matching fails.

Note that any configuration errors will still fail the suite regardless of this setting. This includes exceptions thrown during trigger functions, but does not include exceptions thrown by testResponse functions.

Default: `true` in contract definition, `false` in contract verification

**Signature:**

```typescript
readonly throwOnFail?: boolean;
```
