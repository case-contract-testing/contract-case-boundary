## IInvokeCoreTest.verify() method

Call this to tell the ContractCase core to actually invoke the test.

Note that during verification, a failed verification doesn't return an error Result, but failed configuration or core bugs will. This is the intended default behaviour - as a failed verification doesn't necessarily indicate a problem in the code that is being verified.

**Signature:**

```typescript
verify(): Promise<BoundaryResult>;
```

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[BoundaryResult](./case-boundary.boundaryresult.md)<!-- -->&gt;

a promise that indicates the result of verifying this test (BoundaryResult)
